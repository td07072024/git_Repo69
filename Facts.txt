The Gomti, Gumti or Gomati River is a tributary of the Ganges. According to Hindu belief, the river is the daughter of Rishi Vashishtha and bathing in the Gomti on Ekadashi (the 11th day of the two lunar phases of the Hindu calendar month) can wash away sins.[1] According to the Bhagavata Purana, one of Hinduism's major religious works, Gomti is one of the five transcendental rivers of India.[2] The rare Gomti Chakra is found there.
